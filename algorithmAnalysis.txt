LCG TEST
We found that as modulus increases and as seed decreases, length of random number sequence without duplication increases.
Test LCG with seed = 45 and other parameters: a = 7 b = 133 m = 1000
Length of sequence: 20
Test LCG with seed = 45 and other parameters: a = 2 b = 3 m = 5
Length of sequence: 5
Test LCG with seed = 45 and other parameters: a = 2 b = 10 m = 500
Length of sequence: 22
Test LCG with seed = 200 and other parameters: a = 2 b = 10 m = 500
Length of sequence: 21

LFSR TEST
We found that as number of bit increases and as seed decreases, length of random number sequence without duplication increases.
Test LFSR with seed = 45 and bit = 8
Length of sequence: 255
Test LFSR with seed = 45 and bit = 16
Length of sequence: 1000
Test LFSR with seed = 200 and bit = 16
Length of sequence: 514
Test LFSR with seed = 200 and bit = 32
Length of sequence: 1000

BBS TEST
We found that as M increases and as seed decreases, length of random number sequence without duplication increases.
Test BBS with seed = 45 and other parameters: p = 1091 q = 1109 M = 1209919
Length of sequence: 828
Test BBS with seed = 45 and other parameters: p = 433 q = 439 M = 190087
Length of sequence: 22
Test BBS with seed = 200 and other parameters: p = 433 q = 439 M = 190087
Length of sequence: 20
Test BBS with seed = 200 and other parameters: p = 3673 q = 4337 M = 15929801
Length of sequence: 1000
